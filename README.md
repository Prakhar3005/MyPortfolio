Welcome to my personal portfolio website made on react.js!

To access my portfolio just download the zip file and decompress all the files. 
After that just open the code in some code editor (VS Code preferred).
In that open terminal and type the following command:

### npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


All the code is in src folder in App.js and Components folder(Containing JSX and CSS files of all the pages).
All the assets(images) are in public/assets folder. 

## Now you can view my entire portfolio!!
